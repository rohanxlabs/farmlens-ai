# 🌿 FarmLens AI

> Upload a crop photo. Get an instant AI-powered disease diagnosis and treatment plan.

FarmLens AI is an agriculture-focused AI SaaS that helps farmers identify crop diseases early and get actionable treatment recommendations — powered by Google Gemini Vision.

## 🚀 Live Demo

## 🎯 The Problem

Farmers lose 20–40% of their yield every season due to late or wrong crop disease diagnosis. Most rely on guesswork or wait days for an agronomist visit. By then, the disease has spread.

## ✅ The Solution

Upload a photo of your crop → FarmLens AI identifies the disease, confidence level, and gives a precise treatment recommendation in seconds.

## 🧠 How It Works

```
User uploads crop photo
        ↓
React frontend sends image to Express backend
        ↓
Express sends image + prompt to Gemini 1.5 Flash Vision API
        ↓
Gemini returns structured diagnosis (disease, confidence, treatment)
        ↓
Backend parses and returns JSON
        ↓
Frontend displays animated result card
```
